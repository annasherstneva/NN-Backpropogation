# NN-Backpropogation

Here is:
 - NeuralNetwork.sln - solution file for MSVS2015
 - Neural Network folder - folder with .cpp and .h files of project
 - doc  - folder with report of lab work

For starting program please build the solution

For starting it's necessary to write paths to data with it names:
 - for example: F:\\MNIST\\train-images.idx3-ubyte F:\\MNIST\\train-labels.idx1-ubyte F:\\MNIST\\t10k-images.idx3-ubyte F:\\MNIST\\t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte
 - also you may choose speed of learning. set this parameter after paths

TRAIN DATA:
Number of "good" pictures: 58 682. Part of false positives is 0.022. Precision is 1 - 0.022 = 0.978
TEST DATA:
Number of "good" pictures: 9 944. Part of false positives is 0.0056. Precision is 1 - 0.0056 = 0.9944
