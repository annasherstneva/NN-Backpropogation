# NN-Backpropogation

Here is:
 - Source code (.cpp, .h - files, project & solution - files for MSVS2015)
 - MNIST data
 - Binaries: NeuronNetwork.exe

For starting it's necessary to write paths to data with it names:
 - for example: F:\\MNIST\\train-images.idx3-ubyte F:\\MNIST\\train-labels.idx1-ubyte F:\\MNIST\\t10k-images.idx3-ubyte F:\\MNIST\\t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte
 - also you may choose speed of learning. set this parameter after paths
